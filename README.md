# NLP-for-sentiment-Analysis
This is the fruit of the research project I have worked on as part of my studies at Ecole Centrale de Lyon.

I worked on a dataset of Tweets, which I preprocessed and transformed, into a digital format by two approaches: TF-IDF and Word2vec before feeding the resulting data into some classification models.

## The dataset

- The training dataset : training.json : This file contains ~15k raw tweets, with their polarity labels (1 = positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative). positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative).

- The test dataset : develop.json

## The code
- Code using preprocessing TF-IDF : intro-to-nlp.ipynb

- Code preprocessing using word2vec : word2vec.ipynb
