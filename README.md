# NLP-for-sentiment-Analysis
This is the fruit of the research project I have worked on as part of my studies at Ecole Centrale de Lyon.

I worked on a dataset of Tweets, which I preprocessed and transformed, into a digital format by two approaches: TF-IDF and Word2vec before feeding the resulting data into some classification models.

## The dataset

- The training dataset : "training.json"  contains 16805 raw tweets, with their polarity labels (1 = positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative). 

- The test dataset : "develop.json" contains 1829k raw tweets, with their polarity labels (1 = positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative).

## The code
- Text Vectorization using the approach TF-IDF : intro-to-nlp.ipynb

- Text Vectorization using the approach word2vec : word2vec.ipynb

## The rapport

Please refer to the rapport to further your knowledge of the theory of Word2vec, SVM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation approaches. Note that it is written in French ^_^
